![Gericht Restaurant Gif] (https://github.com/CBelloxxi/gericht-restaurant/blob/main/src/assets/Gericht.gif)

<p> This is the Gericht Restaurant Landing Page built with a Modern UI/UX using React JS. It encompasses all modern UX Practices, follows a stringent and well organised File Structure and uses React Functional components to create a reusable SubHeading component, which has been used multiple times in the project. It also uses the React-Icons Framework, setPlayVideo for handling the logic and restaurant video playback, onClick Handling Events for the logic to create a more interactive site by making the Instagram site feed scrollable. Netlify has also been used for free hosting. </p>

<h2>Built with & Features:</h2>
<li>Javasript</li>
<li>React JS</li>
<li> React Icons Framework</li>
<li>React Functional components and their reusability</li>

<li>Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model</li>
<li>Media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering most devices</li>
<li>Netlify for Hosting</li>

<h2>Improve or Change</h2>
The next steps to continue building this into a fully fledged app would be to build a back end application in which you can sign up, sign-in and create table bookings for your parties, integrate a Map API - either mapbox or google maps to present a location for the restaurant and link the form to an onClick method that submits the form to a google sheet file for reference to the business to use as a customer database and as a small database.
